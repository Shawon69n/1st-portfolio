                <p class="lekhar-rong">In a cat's eye, all things belong to cats. 
                    There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life:
                    music and cats. A lie is like a cat: you 
                    need to stop it before it gets out the door 
                    or it's really hard to catch. A cat will be
                    your friend, but never your slave.One reason 
                    we may love to stroke these adorable creatures 
                    is because the rhythmic action of stroking their 
                    velvety fur feels good. ... I believe that a major 
                    reason we love cats is because of an uncanny 
                    ability that few humans possess: they register 
                    our tactile presence in a deeply felt way.</p>
